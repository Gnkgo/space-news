# Project Pitch
## Project Idea
The project is about want to create a website with three different components: earth, mars, moon. Each component can be accessed to show more data. For the earth we want to show the current asteroids and comets and where they can be found. For Mars will the weatherforecast be shown. For the moon the current state will be displayed.
