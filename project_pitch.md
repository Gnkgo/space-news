# Project Pitch
## Project Idea
The project is about want to create a website with three different components: earth, mars, moon. Each component can be accessed to show more data. For the earth we want to show the current asteroids and comets and where they can be found. For Mars will the weather forecast be shown. For the moon the current state will be displayed.


## Deliverables
- earth
  - interactive world map where we display events like wildfires, storms etc
- near earth object studies
  - asteroids
  - comets
  - fireball
  - NHATS (human-accessible NEOs data)
- mars
  - display the weather, like a weather forecast for mars
  - show pictures of mars at the moment (Mars Rover Photos)
- moon
  - super moon
  - blue moon
  - red moon
  - new moon
  - eclipse


## Pitch
**Title**: 

Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy (draft)
Space News

**What is the need or problem? For whom?**

Gaining knowledge for daily activities in space. For space enthusiasts, curious people and aliens.

**What resources are (not) available (input)?**

- [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/)
- [Moon API](https://dev.qweather.com/en/docs/api/astronomy/moon-and-moon-phase/)
  
**What is your goal for the project**
- be able to retrieve data from an API
- Serve external NASA/moon data in an aesthetic pleasing interface and provide a great user experience
  
**What would be different if the problem was solved?**
  - Brining joy to nerds
  - Having all the important information at one place and not having the need to access different sources

**What are the approaches to solving the problem? Which ones have you already tried**
- Solve each component completely before going to the next one
  - this makes sure that we don't have a lot of unfinished projects
  - can react fast if we notice that one component takes longer than expected
- having a git repository to share the code and see what the others are doing
- Split up work and work efficiently
- So far nothing has been done for the website

**What are the limitations? What do you have to pay attention to?**
- time management (not overdoing yourself)
- missing data from NASA (API's in general)
  
**What is the scope of the project?**
display important information for
- moon
- earth
- mars
- near earth object studies
(look deliverables)
