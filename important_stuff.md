|graphically showing the visibility of the moon. Displaying images. Display next current event. (Full moon, solar eclipse, red moon etc.)|graphically showing weather forecast. Max, min temperature. current picture of mars. Button to change between C and F.|Make it rotating, when is summer when is winter. how to display the rotation? where is the moon? adding a date and timer. Totally cool would be a slider to display how it looks like in 2 months etc.|**Suggestion:** start with that when all the other satellites are done. Start maybe with a 2D representation and a simple arrow where the asteroids are. Check how hard the 3D implementation is.|Maybe keep it simple. Just an arrow to show where a storm is. you could do it with three different maps where different parts of the earth is. Display an arrow with *There is a storm in Arizona* and explain where, what when. Maybe a red dot and when you press on it you see the further information.|
