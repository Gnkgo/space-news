\section*{Project Pitch}
\subsection*{Project Idea}
The project is about wanting to create a website with three different
components: Earth, Mars, and Moon. Each component can be accessed to show more
data about the associated celestial body. For Earth, we want to show the
current asteroids and comets and where they can be found. For Mars, a weather
forecast will be shown. For the Moon, its current state (phase, special
phenomena) will be displayed.

\subsection*{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Earth}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Interactive world map where events like wildfires, storms, etc., are displayed.
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Near Earth Object Studies}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Asteroids
              \item Comets
              \item Fireballs
              \item NHATS (Human-Accessible NEOs Data)
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mars}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Display the weather; like a weather forecast for Mars
              \item Show pictures of Mars at the moment (taken from the Mars Rover)
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Moon}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Super Moon
              \item Blue Moon
              \item Red Moon
              \item New Moon
              \item Eclipse
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\subsection*{Pitch}
\subsubsection*{Title}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
    \item "Space News"
    \item (Both ideas are drafts and subject to change)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is the need or problem? For whom?}
Gaining knowledge for daily activities in space. For space enthusiasts, curious people, and aliens.
\subsubsection*{What resources are (not) available (input)?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://api.nasa.gov/}{NASA API}
    \item \href{https://dev.qweather.com/en/docs/api/astronomy/moon-and-moon-phase/}{Moon API}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is your goal for the project}
Being able to retrieve data from an API. Serving external NASA/Moon data in an aesthetically pleasing interface and providing a great user experience.
\subsubsection*{What would be different if the problem was solved?}
Bringing (more) joy to nerds. Having all the important information in one place and not having to access different sources.
\subsubsection*{What are the approaches to solving the problem? Which ones have you already tried?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solving each component completely before going to the next one
          \begin{itemize}
              \item This makes sure that we do not have a lot of unfinished projects
              \item Can react fast if we notice that one component takes longer than expected
          \end{itemize}
    \item Having a git repository to share the code and see what the others are doing
    \item Splitting up work and working efficiently
    \item So far, nothing has been done for the website
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{What are the limitations? What do you have to pay attention to?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time management (not overdoing oneself)
    \item Missing data from NASA (APIs in general)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{What is the scope of the project?}
Displaying important information about
\begin{itemize}
    \item Earth
    \item Near Earth object studies
    \item Mars
    \item Moon
    \item (see deliverables)
\end{itemize}
